# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammed Azif

🤖 Robotics Engineer | 🌐 ROS 2 Developer | 💻 Simulation Enthusiast

I'm passionate about building intelligent robotic systems that move, think, and interact with the real world. I work on developing and simulating mobile robots and manipulators using ROS 2, Gazebo, RViz, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim. I focus on integrating perception, motion planning, and autonomy in simulated and real environments.
